Scrambled eggs are a classic, simple, and quick dish to prepare. Here's a basic recipe to make scrambled eggs for one serving:
Ingredients:

    2 to 3 large eggs
    1 tablespoon milk or water (optional, for fluffier eggs)
    Salt, to taste
    Pepper, to taste
    1 tablespoon unsalted butter or oil

Instructions:

    Crack the Eggs: Break 2 to 3 large eggs into a bowl.

    Beat the Eggs: Add a tablespoon of milk or water if you want your scrambled eggs to be fluffier. This step is optional. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Beat the eggs together with a fork or a whisk until the mixture is smooth and the color is consistent.

    Preheat the Pan: Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add a tablespoon of unsalted butter or oil to the pan. Let the butter melt or the oil heat up without letting it smoke.

    Cook the Eggs: Once the butter is melted or the oil is heated, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Let them sit, undisturbed, for a few seconds until they begin to set around the edges.

    Scramble the Eggs: With a spatula, gently stir the eggs, pushing them from the edges toward the center. Continue to cook, stirring gently, until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the eggs for a bit.

    Final Seasoning: Taste, and add more salt and pepper if needed.

    Serve Immediately: Scrambled eggs are best enjoyed fresh and hot. Serve them on a plate with your choice of sides, such as toast, sautéed vegetables, or bacon.

Tips:

    For extra creamy scrambled eggs, you can add a dollop of cream cheese, sour cream, or crème fraîche just before the eggs are fully cooked.
    Experiment with adding herbs like chives, parsley, or dill for added flavor.
    Cheese lovers can fold in shredded cheese like cheddar, mozzarella, or feta in the last minute of cooking for gooey deliciousness.

Feel free to adjust the ingredients and cooking time according to your taste and the number of servings you need!
