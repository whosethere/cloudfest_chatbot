Rewarding Innovation: Prize Models for Your Hackathon

Recognizing and rewarding innovation is crucial to attracting top talent, fostering creativity, and motivating participants to push boundaries.
Now that you’ve explored hackathon models, let’s delve into the exciting world of prizes and attendee appreciation! Here, we’ll explore various approaches to incentivize participation and acknowledge outstanding efforts.

Pro-Tip: When choosing prizes, consider your budget, hackathon goals, and target audience.

Monetary Prizes:

    Classic Top Spot Awards: This traditional approach offers cash prizes to winning teams, motivating participation and generating excitement. However, it might attract competition focused solely on winning rather than innovation.
    Tiered Cash Prizes: This approach spreads the wealth, awarding cash prizes for different categories (e.g., most innovative, best technical execution, audience favorite). It encourages a wider range of projects to be recognized for their strengths.
    Travel and Career/Tech Event Stipends: Assist attendees with travel costs, especially those who live far away and might not otherwise participate. This can be expanded to include registration fees for relevant career fairs or tech conferences, fostering professional development.

Non-Monetary Incentives:

    Access to Resources: Provide winners with valuable resources like cloud computing credits, software licenses, or hardware from sponsors. This helps them further develop their project after the hackathon.
    Mentorship Opportunities: Connect winning teams with experienced mentors who can guide them on project development, refining their business plans, or navigating the entrepreneurial landscape.
    Conference or Workshop Tickets: Offer free or discounted tickets to relevant conferences or workshops, expanding their knowledge and networking opportunities.
    Job Offers or Interviews: Companies sponsoring or participating in the hackathon may offer winning teams or standout individuals job interviews or even direct job offers.
    Public Recognition: Highlight winning teams on social media, your hackathon website, or press releases. This provides valuable exposure and validation for their work.
    Open Source Contribution Recognition: For Open Source Hackathons, recognize outstanding contributions to existing projects or provide credit for code developed during the event.

Beyond the Basics: Hybrid and Creative Approaches

    Hybrid Prize Packages: Combine monetary and non-monetary incentives to create a more attractive prize package. Cash prizes grab initial attention, while non-monetary incentives offer long-term value and support for project development.
    Community-Driven Prizes: Allow attendees to vote for a “People’s Choice” award, fostering a sense of community and encouraging participants to showcase their projects effectively.
    Gamification: Integrate gamification elements like points for completing tasks or reaching milestones. Award prizes based on points accumulated or use points as a secondary entry system for certain prize categories. This can increase engagement and motivation throughout the hackathon.

Pro-Tip: The key is to tailor your prize structure to your hackathon’s goals and target audience. By offering a well-rounded mix of monetary and non-monetary incentives, you can effectively reward innovation, appreciate attendee efforts, and leave a lasting positive impression.*

Funding Your Hackathon Dream: Fundings, Sponsorships and Beyond

Securing funding is vital for bringing your hackathon vision to life. Here, we’ll explore how to leverage sponsorships alongside other creative funding options:

Unleashing the Power of Sponsorships:

Sponsorships are a win-win scenario. Companies gain brand exposure and access to top talent, while you get the resources needed to run a successful event. Here’s how to tap into this powerful funding source:

    Leverage Your Network: Start by reaching out to your personal and professional network. Do you know anyone working at companies that might be interested in sponsoring your hackathon? These initial connections can be invaluable in opening doors to conversations with decision-makers.

    Hitting the Event Trail: Consider attending industry events and conferences. These gatherings provide excellent opportunities to connect with potential sponsors directly. Research the companies exhibiting or sponsoring the event to identify those that align with your hackathon’s goals and target audience.

Beyond Sponsorships: Exploring Additional Funding Avenues:

While sponsorships are a cornerstone of hackathon funding, here are some additional options to consider:

    Registration Fees: For some hackathon models, implementing a registration fee can help offset costs. However, ensure the fee remains accessible to your target audience.
    Grants: Research grant opportunities offered by organizations that support innovation or entrepreneurship initiatives that resonate with your hackathon model.
    Creative Fundraising: Get creative! Explore crowdfunding platforms or host fundraising events to generate additional income.

Pro-Tip: When approaching potential sponsors, tailor your pitch to their interests. Highlight how your hackathon aligns with their brand and how sponsoring can benefit them. Be prepared to offer different sponsorship packages that cater to various budgets and needs.
Building Your Dream Team: Assembling a Hackathon Powerhouse

Your hackathon’s success hinges on the team you assemble. A diverse group with the right skillsets can turn your vision into reality. Picking up after finalizing your hackathon model and prizing structure, let’s dive into the essential roles that will make your event a powerhouse of innovation.

Pro-Tip: Seek individuals who are passionate, efficient, and excited about your hackathon theme!

Core Team Composition:

    Technical Wizards: This group builds the hackathon platform, manages website development, wrangles data (if applicable), and crafts a winning social media strategy aligned with your chosen hackathon model.

    Marketing Mavens: This crew promotes your event, attracts participants and sponsors, and crafts compelling content for the website and social media channels, keeping your hackathon model front and center.
    Judging Jedi Knights: Recruit industry experts to evaluate and award prizes based on the criteria set within your prizing model. These Jedi Knights will identify the most innovative and impactful projects.
    Accessibility Advocates: This team champions inclusivity, ensuring the event caters to participants with disabilities, reflecting your commitment to a diverse and welcoming environment regardless of the chosen hackathon model.

Team Building Strategies:

    Volunteer Powerhouse: Leverage the passion and dedication of volunteers to support various tasks.
    Sponsor Synergy: Explore opportunities where sponsors contribute employee time or expertise, fostering collaboration and resource sharing.
    Paid Professionals: Budget for essential roles that require specialized skills and cannot be fulfilled by volunteers.

Building a Strong Foundation:

    Clear Timeline: Establish a timeline with key milestones and deadlines for each team to maintain focus and efficiency.
    Open Communication: Create consistent communication channels (e.g., project management tools, regular meetings) to ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards shared goals.

By assembling a diverse and skilled team, you’ll be well-equipped to create a seamless and impactful hackathon experience that fosters innovation and empowers participants.
Done Until here

    Venue
    set priorities
    size, easy access with public transport, cost, location/city, if you can work with professionals they can solve your problems for you.
    hotels are very good for that, especially hotels that provide conference rooms.

If you have an event the year before go though your survey from the last year and so you can check the learnings from it and try to implement what you agree with.

    Judgment
    Decide if/who/when will judge the results of the projects. These people should not in a project or from a company that has a project in the conference. This is not too serious most of the time except if there is a big price involved where a rooster and criteris need to be super clear for the begining, and be sure tha tthe judges are experts that can actually judge the projects.
    If companies are the challenge setters ask them to judge the result themselves. Sometimes in a semi-final type of deal.

Pricing/cost timeline for the early bird tickets, student discounts etc:
Building Momentum (4-2 Months Before)

With a solid foundation laid during the Pre-Hackathon Prep phase, it’s time to shift gears and focus on building excitement! This crucial phase, which can run concurrently with some aspects of Pre-Hackathon Prep, centers around attracting participants and sponsors to ensure a vibrant and successful event.
Power of Timing: Choosing Your Hackathon Dates**

The date selection for your hackathon significantly impacts your ability to secure funding and attract participants. Here are some key factors to consider:

    Target Audience Availability: Avoid scheduling during major holidays, religious observances, or school breaks that might impact your target audience’s ability to participate.
    Existing Events: Research for any regional or industry events that could conflict with your chosen dates. Overlapping events can create scheduling difficulties for attendees (exhausted from attending two events) and sponsors (limited budget to sponsor multiple events in close proximity).
    Venue Availability: Ensure your preferred venue has availability on the chosen dates. High-demand periods may lead to increased venue rental costs.
    Sponsor Availability: Communicate with potential sponsors to ensure their key personnel and resources are available during your planned hackathon dates. Sponsorship budgets are often allocated for specific timeframes, and they might not be able to support two events happening close together.

Finding the Funding Sweet Spot:

By strategically selecting your hackathon dates, you can create a more favorable environment for securing funding and attracting key partners. Here’s how:

    Sponsor Alignment: A well-timed hackathon can attract sponsors who might be more inclined to invest if the event falls outside peak sponsorship periods for other events. This can lead to potentially better sponsorship deals.
    Participant Interest: Scheduling your event during periods with fewer competing events allows you to capture the full attention of your target audience, leading to a higher registration rate.

Pro-Tip: When finalizing your hackathon dates, consider a balance between minimizing scheduling conflicts, optimizing sponsor and participant availability, and maximizing cost-effectiveness.
Develop Your Brand Identity: Crafting a Memorable Image (Expanded)

Your brand identity is the face of your hackathon. It’s what will catch people’s attention and leave a lasting impression. Here’s how to craft a truly memorable image:

    Choose a Catchy Name: Brainstorm names that are relevant to your hackathon theme, concise, and easy to remember. Consider wordplay or unique combinations that spark curiosity.
    Design a Stellar Logo: Create a logo that visually represents your brand identity. It should be visually appealing, scalable, and work well across different mediums (online, print, etc.). Consider colors, fonts, and imagery that align with your hackathon theme and target audience.
    Establish Consistent Visuals: Develop a brand style guide that defines your color palette, typography, and overall visual language. This ensures consistency across all your marketing materials, from your website to social media posts, creating a recognizable and unified brand experience.

By investing time and creativity into your brand identity, you’ll attract attention, build trust, and differentiate your hackathon from the crowd.
Craft a Compelling Website: Your Information Hub

Your website is the central hub for all things related to your hackathon. It serves as a vital information resource for potential attendees, sponsors, and anyone interested in learning more about your event. Here’s how to create a website that informs, engages, and converts:

    Content is King: Develop a clear and informative website structure that prioritizes easy navigation. Utilize clear menus and a logical site architecture so visitors can effortlessly find the information they need.

    Speak Plainly: Avoid technical jargon and complex sentences. Write in a clear, concise, and engaging manner that everyone can understand, regardless of technical background.

    Content that Captivates: Craft compelling content that showcases the following points:

        Hackathon Theme and Challenges: Provide a detailed overview of the hackathon theme, including any specific challenges or areas of focus.

        Team Registration Process: Outline the team registration process, including any requirements or steps participants need to follow.

        Evaluation Criteria/Rubric: Clearly define the judging criteria, outlining what factors will be considered when evaluating projects.

        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Anticipate potential questions from visitors and provide clear, concise answers in a dedicated FAQ section.

        Sponsor Opportunities (if applicable): If you’re seeking sponsors, showcase attractive sponsorship opportunities and the benefits of partnering with your hackathon.

        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Anticipate potential questions from visitors and provide clear, concise answers in a dedicated FAQ section. Here are some common questions to consider addressing in your FAQ section:
            Venue and Location, Accommodations, Travel and Visas, Food and Beverages, Team Formation, Eligibility

        Visual Storytelling: Don’t underestimate the power of visuals! Complement your text content with captivating images, videos, and infographics. Consider including clips from previous events (if applicable) to set the atmosphere and provide a glimpse into the hackathon experience.

        Clear Calls to Action (CTAs): Clearly tell visitors what you want them to do next. Whether it’s registering for the hackathon, learning more about sponsors, or signing up for your newsletter, make desired actions prominent and easy to find with clear CTAs.

    Building Community:
    Develop a comprehensive communication strategy to keep everyone informed throughout the entire process. Foster a sense of community by integrating social media feeds or creating a dedicated forum where attendees and sponsors can connect, interact, and build relationships. Here are some communication channels you can leverage, many with free and open-source options:

    Email/Newsletter Marketing: Utilize email marketing tools like Mautic (https://www.mautic.org/) to send informative newsletters and updates about the hackathon.

    Chat Platforms: Integrate a chat platform like Rocket.Chat (https://rocket.chat/enterprise/open-source) or Mattermost (https://mattermost.com/open-source-slack-alternative/) to facilitate real-time communication among attendees, sponsors, and organizers.

Finalizing the Details: Securing Your Venue

With a solid foundation laid and a captivating website attracting interest, it’s time to secure the logistics for your hackathon. Here’s what you need to consider:

    Venue Selection:
        Location: Choose a venue that is centrally located and easily accessible by public transportation or with ample parking options. Consider the proximity to amenities like restaurants and hotels, especially if your hackathon attracts participants from out of town.
        Space and Capacity: Ensure the venue can comfortably accommodate your expected number of participants, with adequate space for working areas, presentations, breaks, and potential networking areas.
        Facilities: Verify that the venue has the necessary facilities to support your hackathon, including reliable wifi, power outlets, audio/visual equipment (projectors, screens), and comfortable seating.
        Catering: Discuss catering options with the venue or explore alternative solutions for providing meals and refreshments throughout the hackathon.

    Securing the Venue:
        Contract Negotiation: Negotiate a contract with the venue that clearly outlines the rental terms, including costs, cancellation policies, and any additional services included (security, cleaning, etc.).
        Deposits and Payments: Finalize any required deposits or upfront payments to secure the venue for your desired dates.

Pro-Tip: Clearly advertise your chosen communication channels on your website, making it easy for visitors to find and connect with you. Additionally, consider accessibility by providing links to alternative communication methods for those who might not be able to utilize the listed chat platforms.

Need Deadlines and Tracking

Things to keep track of:

    Teams forming and communication
    Vollunteers and outside help
    Cool/fun things
    Budget

Setting Deadlines:

A lot of elements of every event are time-critical. For a hackathon deadlines need to be set for:

    Sign-ups, Extentions and Number of attendees

Hotel deals and bookings usually requier a certain number of attendees and have deadlines for changes to the booking. It is good to set the deadline for sign-ups while you can still change/arrange the hotel bookings.

For example:

Text

    Changes in the orriginal plan

Events are constantly evolving and people need to stay in the loop, but not everyone needs to know everything and not everything needs to be communicated immediatelly. Having a good newsletter structure where groups of people like (attendees, sponsors, organisors, volunteers, etc) can recieve information through email can help avoid spam and make sure that people read all of the emails you sent.

    Collect Project pitches/information

    X attendees

    Give information to attendees / Newsletters

    Collect Project pitches

    Organising the Volunteers

    An option to sign off (A lot of people jump off because other things come up)

    An option to form teams because the hackathon starts

Suggestions

Depending on the state of the budget and the general values of the event several options can be given to the attendees in the application process.

    Dietary restrictions: If you are handling catering it is important to make sure you have something for everyone. But if you want to save on the catering you can offer only vegetarian or vegan meals limiting options in favour of streamlining the catering.
    Stay: If you are offering lodging for the event allowing the participants to choose if they want to share rooms with some other participant can lower hotel costs significantly.
    Tickets: It is generaly a bad practice to charge a fee to participants who will offer their expertise for free in your event. That said there are cases where the cost of the event (ncluding catering and stay for example) can not be covered completelly and you can try to pose a small ticket for the attendees. Another reason to pose a small fee is to ensure commitment from them.
    Fun: Depending on the hackathon you are planning to run and the available budget organisers are called to set up some social activities, outside lunch dinner and coffee. Your inspiration can come from your community (What do they enjoy doing?). Otherwise some drinks in a local bar or even games in the venue itself (if you are allowed to stay afterhours) can be a great idea.
    Social media: Often social media posting is not prioritised in a hackathon. Setting up a hashtag and possibly a competision can insentivise your participants to post.

Stage 4 (Event)

This is the stage that you face near and during the event, and perhaps after the event closing. You can navigate through the event smoothly if you follow these steps.

    Verify Readiness
    Make sure you confirm that all necessary preparations have been completed before officially starting the hackathon. Check that technical infrastructure, including internet connectivity and power outlets, is functioning properly. Ensure that all logistical arrangements, such as venue setup and signage, are in place.

    Food and Beverage Management
    Coordinate with catering services to ensure continuous availability of food and beverages throughout the event. Monitor consumption levels and replenish supplies as needed to accommodate participants’ needs. Address any dietary preferences or restrictions to ensure all participants are catered to appropriately.

    Technical Infrastructure Support

Monitor the availability and performance of the ideapad, code repository, wiki/documentation, and chat/emailing list platforms. Offer guidance and assistance to participants in utilizing these technical resources effectively.

    Social Media Engagement
    Continue to utilize social media platforms to share updates and highlights from the ongoing event. Encourage participants to share their experiences and project progress on social media using event hashtags. Don’t forget to respond to comments and engage with participants and followers to foster a sense of community and excitement.

    Live Streaming
    You have to ensure that you maintain the live streaming setup not only for remote attendees but also for marketing purposes for future hackathons. Capture key moments, participant interactions, and project demos to showcase the event’s highlights. Use the live stream to promote the hackathon’s atmosphere, engagement, and innovation to potential participants and sponsors for future editions.

Use designated communication channels to disseminate information efficiently and ensure that all participants are informed. Keep an open line of communication with volunteers, mentors, sponsors, and other stakeholders to coordinate activities and address any issues that arise.

    Closing Activities
    It’s better to beforehand plan and execute a closing ceremony to celebrate the achievements of participants and announce winners.
